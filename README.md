# Talking-Bot

Made a program that talks to the user via text messages in the console or speaks the message.
It replies randomly with bunch of messages mentioned in the list.

How IT Works:

first it prompts user a message that wether he would like to read the messages or read them.
if the user writes "text" in the console it keeps taking input from the user and replies randomly to any message.
if the user writes "speak" in the console it keeps taking input from the user and speaks any random message provided in the list.
if user writes anything else then it prints "invalid input" and asks the user wether he would like to try again or not. If the user replies with yes it promts him the same question but if he replies with "no" then the program stops.
the messages and the input keeps promting until user writes "end" in the console. Once he writes "end" the prompts stop.
